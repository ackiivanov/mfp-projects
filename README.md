# mfp-projects

This is a repository of all the projects I have done as part of the content of the
course "Practicum of Mathematical Physics" ("Matematiƒçno-Fizikalni Praktikum").
It includes topics from numerical calculations and precission to the Fast Fourier
Transform to different methods for solving of many types of differential eqautions.
